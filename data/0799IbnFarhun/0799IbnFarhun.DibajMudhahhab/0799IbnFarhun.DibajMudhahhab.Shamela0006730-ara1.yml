90#VERS#COMMENT##: There are a few minor scribal errors (e.g., definite
    article missing from names, occasionally misspelling of names, e.g.,
    abid for abd). Numbers are also missing from main biographical entry
    titles. Pagination occasionally out by a few lines (e.g., v1:390/1).
    Page 341 of v2 is not included in the digital edition as the page is out
    of order (it contains entries under ya', but is in a section dedicated
    to mim).
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): In the first section I kept the ### $ tags for names although it’s just a list of names without any explanation. I tagged the second section again since the tags were not consistent. I think the typist has typed the text with an eye on Dār al-kutub edition (https://archive.org/details/010255) which is more consistent in headers. 2- Other editions are accessible: https://archive.org/details/yoooooofs_gmail_1_20180125_1808; https://archive.org/details/Dibaj_Muthahab_Ibn_Farahoun
