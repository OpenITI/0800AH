90#VERS#COMMENT##: JK and Shamela versions are the same text, I picked the Shamela version as it already had some tagging in place. Unclear which edition was used for this, so I have annotated based on the edition found on archive.org (this is also the one noted in "collated" above). It's likely that this is not the same edition however, as the pagination is different (however, note that pages seem unusually long in the digital editions). As the text matches and the textual structure is rather easy to follow, I have annotated on textual logic, as also outlined in the introduction. However, the text quality is not super high, I came across quite a lot of typos. I have corrected some when I saw them. On the last 2 pages the long final poem of the text has not been preserved in full: after the first two lines only the first half of each line is included here, the rest is missing (also in the JK version).
