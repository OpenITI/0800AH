90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence with the printed ed.
    The metadata stated that the electronic edition is based upon
    a Dar al-Kutub published text, but it is based upon a Dar al-Fikr edition.
    The worldcat is for a Dar al-Fikr edition from 1900,
    but there is no date on the pdf edition.
    All qa'idas are introduced by al-qāʿida plus ordinal number,
    e.g., القاعدة الأولى +, usually, ':' + qāʿida text on new line.
    The scribe copied the entire qāʿida to make a title;
    I have, however, removed this as it means each qāʿida is otherwise appearing
    twice.
    The scribe has also highlighted parts of the text that follows the main qāʿidas;
    these appear to be different qāʿidas but whether they are all qawāʿid I am
    unsure;
    they are marked as subordinate sections.
    Page divisions are erroneous occasionally after around pg. 300.
