90#VERS#COMMENT##: Close correspondence with printed edition.
    Removed editorial sections and cleaned text of random chars, etc.
    Cannot find edition published by Maktabat al-Mufīd, n.d., on worldcat.
    Each qāʿida is in a separate section but the actual qāʿida
    isn't necessarily clearly delineated from the rest of the text.
    Indices are included (marked as Editorial sections),
    and these include all qāʿidas.
    VOl 2, pg. 27 was missing (now replaced w/ OCR).
    PV removed Editorial section at end of vol. 1.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
