    Some qāʿidas are introduced with 'qāʿida:'
    and detailed on following line,
    but may also be referred to in other ways
    (e.g., referred back to after quotation).
    A number, however, have been highlighted
    by the scribe in the following format:
    new line, between square brackets, e.g.,
    [إذا اتسع الأمر ضاق].
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
