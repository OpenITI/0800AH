90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has been tagged before; no proper YML file
        yet.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Pages 117-161 are missing; most probably because it
        is mainly in Persian and is omitted intentionally by the typist. However, this
        part should be added, not just to have a complete version of the text, but also
        because the last pages are in Arabic and contain biographical entries again.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
